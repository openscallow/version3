                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>A new map in an 8th-grade textbook has ignited a debate about historical accuracy. The map, featured in a publication by the NCERT, portrays the region of modern-day Rajasthan as being under the control of the Maratha Empire during the mid-18th century. This has drawn sharp criticism from various quarters, who argue that the depiction is misleading and not based on historical facts, leading to a call for its immediate withdrawal and correction.</p>

                <h2>The Map's Depiction</h2>
                <p>The core of the controversy lies in a single map illustrating the extent of the Maratha Empire in the year 1759. The map includes almost the entirety of what is now Rajasthan within the Maratha dominion. Critics argue that while the Marathas did have influence and conducted raids in the region, the princely states of Rajasthan, including major powers like Mewar, Marwar, Jaipur, and Bikaner, never fully came under Maratha rule and maintained their independence.</p>

                <h2>Royal Families Voice Strong Objections</h2>
                <p>The issue was first brought to public attention by Chaitanya Raj Singh, a member of the former Jaisalmer royal family. He labeled the map "factually incorrect, misleading and agenda-driven" on social media. His stance was quickly supported by other former royal families. Mahima Kumari, a BJP MP and member of the erstwhile Mewar royal family, along with her husband Vishwaraj Singh, also joined the chorus demanding that the NCERT rectify the error to prevent the dissemination of incorrect historical information to students.</p>

                <h2>Claims of Historical Inaccuracy</h2>
                <p>Opponents of the map argue that it presents a flawed understanding of the political landscape of 18th-century India. They contend that historical records clearly show the princely states of Rajasthan maintained their autonomy. Former Union Minister Bhanwar Jitendra Singh, from the Alwar royal family, emphasized that history should be based on verifiable facts, not regional or political agendas. He stated that the map's portrayal of complete Maratha control over Rajasthan is a historical misrepresentation, as the Rajput states were independent entities.</p>

                <h2>Political Backlash and Demands for Correction</h2>
                <p>The controversy has also taken a political turn, with leaders demanding government intervention. The collective demand from royal families and politicians is for the NCERT to remove the controversial map from the textbook and issue a corrected version. They stress the importance of presenting an accurate and unbiased account of history in educational materials to ensure students receive a fact-based education.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The dispute over the NCERT map highlights the sensitive nature of historical representation in educational textbooks. The strong reactions from Rajasthan's former royal families and political figures have sparked a wider debate on the need for accuracy and the potential for such materials to create a skewed understanding of the past. The incident underscores the importance of a rigorous, evidence-based approach to the writing of history textbooks to avoid such controversies in the future.</p>
