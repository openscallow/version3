                <h2>Introduction: A Silent Strain on Families</h2>
                <p>For many parents, the start of a new school year brings excitement—but also financial stress. Beyond tuition fees, the soaring costs of uniforms and stationery quietly drain household budgets. From mandatory branded blazers to inflated stationery kits, families are left paying much more than the actual value of these items.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="market-monopolies" class="section">
                <h2>Market Monopolies: How Schools Restrict Competition</h2>
                <p>A common reason for inflated costs is the monopoly created by schools. Parents are often forced to buy from “approved shops” chosen by the management, eliminating price competition. This allows vendors to charge far more than market rates, leaving families with no alternative.</p>

            <section id="oversized-packs" class="section">
                <h2>Oversized Stationery Packs and Unnecessary Extras</h2>
                <p>Many schools bundle stationery into oversized kits containing far more items than children need. Parents report being charged for multiple staplers, sharpeners, or drawing tools that remain unused throughout the year. These unnecessary inclusions inflate expenses and burden families unfairly.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="weak-oversight" class="section">
                <h2>Weak Oversight and Regulation</h2>
                <p>Despite government orders to prevent schools from overcharging, monitoring remains weak. Loopholes in enforcement allow schools to continue adding hidden costs under the guise of “non-tuition” expenses.</p>

            <section id="local-pushback" class="section">
                <h2>Local Pushback and Policy Responses</h2>
                <p>Some education departments have started intervening. In cities like Ahmedabad, officials have issued warnings and fines to schools that coerce parents into buying from set vendors. Such measures indicate that local authorities are beginning to recognize the problem, though widespread solutions are still lacking.</p>

            <section id="conclusion" class="section">
                <h2>Conclusion: Time for Fair Practices in Education</h2>
                <p>While education is meant to empower children, the rising cost of uniforms and stationery undermines its accessibility. Parents should not have to struggle financially over basic school supplies. Stronger regulations, fair pricing, and greater transparency are needed to ensure that learning remains affordable for all families.</p>
