                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>A major controversy is brewing in Surat, Gujarat, after school notebooks featuring photos of top BJP leaders were handed out to students. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has slammed the move, sparking a heated debate about politics finding its way into the classroom through students' school supplies.</p>

                <h2>A Political Surprise in School Bags</h2>
                <p>The issue began when the Municipal Education Board, Surat (MEBS), distributed educational kits to around 1.80 lakh students from classes 2 to 8. Inside these kits, each student found five notebooks. The surprise was on the cover: prominent photos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP National President JP Nadda, Gujarat BJP President CR Paatil, and Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel.</p>

                <h2>AAP Cries Foul Over 'Political Propaganda'</h2>
                <p>The matter was quickly raised by AAP member Rakesh Hirpara during a MEBS meeting. He questioned why these political leaders were featured on notebooks and what their direct contribution to education was. The AAP also highlighted a curious omissionâ€”the photo of Gujarat's own Education Minister, Praful Panseriya, who is from Surat, was nowhere to be seen.</p>

                <h2>The Official Response: 'Just Something New'</h2>
                <p>When confronted, officials defended their decision. One BJP member argued that the leaders were featured simply because they are the "topmost leaders of the BJP." The MEBS Chairman, Rajendra Kapadia, gave a more straightforward reason, stating that the board simply wanted to do "something new" this year.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The controversy over Surat's school notebooks has become a classic example of the clash between political messaging and educational ideals. While the authorities describe it as an innovative choice, the opposition sees it as an inappropriate use of school materials for political gain. The central question remains: who should be the role models featured on the covers of books meant for learning?</p>
